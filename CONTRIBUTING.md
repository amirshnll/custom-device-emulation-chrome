# Contributing

I love your contribution! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the info
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new device information

## Pull Request Process
1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This creates a personal copy for you to work on.
2. **Create a New Branch**: In your forked repository, create a new branch for your changes. Name the branch something relevant to the changes you are making.
3. **Commit Your Changes**: Make your changes in your branch and commit them. Be sure to write clear, concise commit messages that explain the changes you've made.
4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Once your changes are committed, push your new branch to your GitHub fork and then create a pull request from your branch to the main repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes and why they should be included in the main project.


## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/amirshnll/custom-device-emulation-chrome/issues)

Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background about your problem
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected
